 Hon'ble Members, the 228th session of the Rajya Sabha which commenced on February 21, 2013 with the Address of the Rashtrapati ji, comes to a close today. The record of the work done, and not done, is in the public domain and in no need of commentary. Details will be made available by the Secretary General. The experience of this session, and particularly of its second half, should induce cogitation on a number of matters arising out of the situations in which the House finds itself in its daily functioning. Three questions in particular need to be addressed: Has the balance between deliberations, legislations and accountability been lost due to regular disruption of the proceedings? Has the time not come to bridge the growing gap between the Rules of Procedures and the need felt by different sections of the House to voice opinion on matters of concern? This, needless to say has to be done in an orderly manner to preserve the dignity of the House, and Has the membership of this august body assessed the impact of disruptive behaviour on public opinion? National song (Vande Mataram) The House is adjourned sine die.
